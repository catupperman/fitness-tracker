## Description
> This project entailed building a fitness tracker.  The tracker allows for you to enter in your weight, duration of workout, and what type of exercise you were performing.  This application will allow you to log these activities and then retrieve them at a later date to keep "track" of your exercise.  Hence, the Fitness Tracker.

<!-- > Feel free to visit and test our application [Here!](https://guarded-meadow-10732.herokuapp.com/) -->

## Installation
> I pulled the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package, aka ```package.json```, entered ```npm install``` , and then used the ```require``` method to direct the routes for each of the items within the directory. 
Applications used to create the Fitness Tracker: 
> * node 
> * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
> * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_content=rlsavisitor&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_americas_uscan_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop_rlsa&utm_term=mongo%20db&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=14291004479&gclid=CjwKCAjw49qKBhAoEiwAHQVTo38V301P0bOVlk9P20vf-_4foVY5yjU-POKxuEcIurfIYqM-xghdkxoCa-oQAvD_BwE)

## Contributions
> My teacher, and TAs were a big help in explaining the process of MongoDB and Mongoose.  My tutor, Corey Yates, was a big help when I was having some trouble in a few pain points. Not only was she helpful, but educational.  
## Testing
> To test the application, I began to run the server using ```node server.js``` in the terminal.  Then checking the web page to make sure the application was running smoothly from page to page, and holding onto the data after entering.
